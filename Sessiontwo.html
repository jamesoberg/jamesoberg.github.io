					<p>Our intrepid travellers found themselves in the sparkling cavern with the lovely pool, took a short rest to recover a little (not noticing any ill effects from the wondrous cavern), and set off once more. Determined to travel deeper into the mountain, the players continued past the corpses of the Violet Funguses slain last session, and found themselves falling through a fragile floor in the semi-natural tunnel, into a new tunnel that was anything but.
					<br><br>
					After dropping ten feet, Margora found herself in an exceptionally smooth tunnel; steep, but safe. She was quickly joined by the others, and Grakhelda was able to tell that this tunnel was definitely not of Dwarven origin, and looked too smooth to be hewn by any tool she's aware of. From this point, party eschewed the choice to travel somewhat steeply upward and westward, instead travelling more deeply into the mountain, very steeply downward and eastward. 
					<br><br>
					Coming to a bare rock face, Margora had a moment of inspiration and used a spell slot to cast Detect Magic, instantly revealing the shape of a normal-sized door in the rock. Feeling for a handle, she found one, turned it, pulled gently, and the party was met with the sight of a terrifying, absolutely gargantuan red-coloured dragon, who turned toward the door immediately and shouted harshly in Draconic. Presumably assuming themselves to have blundered into a Tiamat-worshipping Red Dragon's lair, the party failed to avoid becoming terrified and fled immediately, only for the Dragon to dismissively wave a claw at the door and cause it to slam shut with an angry "BANG!".
					<br><br>
					Apparently not dead, the party decided not to press their luck and travelled back up the smooth tunnel some few hundred feet, finding another magically hidden door at the end of it, leading back into the Dwarven tunnels. Before checking that it could be closed and opened again, the party marked rock above the door with some oil and pressed on. Weren't we here for goats, or something?
					<br><br>
					Back into familiar(ish) territory, in a short, partially dug tunnel offshoot, the party found two ancient skeletons of Dwarven miners, who appeared to have been murdered while on the job, perhaps with some kind of edged weapon, by the skull marks. Moving on a little further, in another tunnel offshoot lay another dead Dwarven miner, this one having had the wherewithal to quickly hide their pouch of gold, which also contained a medium-sized, raw Turquoise gemstone.
					<br><br>
					The party resolved to head back to the original place they first heard the sound of running water, having extracted the information from the Koboldites that the others of their kin had set themselves up near the water. Along the way, they discovered an exceptionally well-hidden door which SEEMED to be rock, but did not yield to Margora's attempts to cast Mold Earth on it. After speaking some Dwarven words and names at it, and not seeing any other way to get it open, they moved on.
					<br><br>
					Continuing to explore, the party came across a tunnel with a small trickle of running water coming from the west and heading to the east. "What the hell", said they, "there might be something fun deeper into the mountain", and so to the east they went. Passing another dead Dwarven miner who had been carrying some ruby dust (Grakhelda suspects for prospecting purposes), the party descended into another nearly untouched natural tunnel, when a small stalactite suddenly dropped from the ceiling, hitting Grakhelda's shoulder. Quickly dispatching it, the party moved on, finding another living stalactite which put up a little more of a fight, but still succumbed to the volley of blows directed at it. Hurrah!
					<br><br>
					Moving on once more, the adventurers followed the natural cavern system to find a large open cave. A careful search revealed a native vein of ruby gemstone, sitting right there in the rock face! What luck! Carefully positioning his dagger next to the vein, Kass deftly rammed the butt of his club into his dagger hilt... and hit the gemstone square in the middle. The good news is, the party now has four small rubies! The bad news is, they missed out on taking a large one away. Not to worry, I'm sure the overall value hasn't been enormously reduced, but maybe Mold Earth next time ;)
					<br><br>
					Oh right, goats, or whatever... Heading back to up to the slope to the west, the party came upon a familiar intersection, one they had initially followed to the right and into the lovely pooled cavern. Instead going to the left, and wisely adopting a stealthy approach, the party managed to spot a group of Kobold ambushers, bigger and more numerous than they had encountered previously! Ambushing the ambushers, the party mercilessly set upon the Kobolds and cleft several of them in twain before they could even respond. The fight was short and bloody and our victors emerged almost unscathed. Bravo! They found themselves in another ancient Dwarven bivouac, this one with a heavily runed wall... More on that later.
					<br><br>
					It was noticed that the two small Kobolds here were the same two the party had released earlier. It was surmised that upon being released, they had run here to report of the party's presence, and the larger Kobolds had set up the ambush. Having kept the Kobold Captain alive, he was interrogated and revealed that the goats (at last! Goats!) they had captured had disappeared upon passing the illusory rock face entrance to the cave system, and that this wasn't the first time it had happened. He claimed total ignorance over how it had happened. He also expressed terror at the mention of the dragon deeper in the mountain, claiming "we don't go down there... It's not a follower of Tiamat". Having had enough, the players slew the sorry creature.
					<br><br>
					Finally, the wall covered in runes was investigated by Kass and Grakhelda...
					<br><br><i>"To any who may read this, we have come under siege by foul creatures of the deep and are surely to meet Dumathoin before long. All exits are cut off. The surveys were inaccurate, there there is some wealth to be found in this cursed mountain. We are cut off from the cache, praise be to Moradin that the enchanter Gamverend was able to seal it before our retreat. The hidden door will not yield unless met with a key whose identity we pray will only be understood by a life-loving Dwarf. Be the cache lost and looted upon entry, Gamverend begs Durgind's forgiveness at his failure. Gem veins lie herein, some minor iron ores poor in quality, and no sign of mithral. We have precious few hours left. Remember us comrades, may you have better fortune than we have had in this foul mountain. I am opening the remainder of this rock face for the farewells and messages of my brave compatriots."</i>
					<br><br>
					Following this, there were dozens of messages written in hurriedly scrawled runic, from many different hands. Amongst the messages was a central, carefully written set of stanzas:
					<br><br>
					<i>I am a god to many,<br>
					Sworn enemy to some,<br>
					I can be friend to any,<br>
					But in truth I favour none.<br><br>
					
					Though maligned I’ve often been,<br>
					You needn’t sympathise,<br>
					For nought is ever seen,<br>
					Through my one-and-one-score eyes.<br>
					<br></i>
					With a couple of solutions having been mentioned, the party resolved to return to the hidden door they were earlier unable to open. And that is where we end our tale this week! Next time we shall see if our travellers have indeed solved the riddle, or if more thinking is to be done!
					<br><br></p>

					Be it forever known by mortals, Gods, devils and all, that Fengat Golgor and Bolgi Gurboggin were the dearest of friends in life, and shall remain so in death.
					<br><br>
					We two brothers, Delgu and Belgu Frothglin, lived and died in service of our clan, let it be known that our duty was never abandoned.
					<br><br>
					I, Grumduggir of no clan, have harder marbles than anything our pickaxes have met in this filthy hole!
					<br><br>
					I fucked Crawkin's sister. (-Gadon)
					<br>
					Gadon is a liar. (-Crawkin)
					<br>
					I've a tiny serpent and wear false beard braids, but your sister didn't mind! (-Gadon)
					<br>
					I probably fucked both your sisters! (-unsigned)
					<br><br>
					May we kill more than quadruple our own number. To battle and song! (-Sifreg)
					<br><br>
					I fucked Lellfinlaz, bargirl at the Snarling Owlbear. (-Sheckmind)
					<br><br>
					I fucked an elf. I know not if she conceived. If a wide, red-nosed, coal-haired half-caste comes looking for me, give them my effects and my name. And my endless apologies, I never looked for them, in spite of my honour. (-Rudgin Stornid)
					<br><br>
					I, Gontholin Glemgide, am the mother of twelve children, please beg their forgiveness that I have left them, only to come here and die."
					<br><br>
					I have buggered a priest of Berronar. He is called Gendallin. I recommend him highly. (-unsigned)
					<br><br>
					Before I die, I herevy swear i'll castrate one of these filthy scum and mount his manhood between my heaving tits! (-Halgalda)
					<br><br>
					The High Priest of Moradin has known my cunt. He is far too good a lover not to have known many more! His marbles are divine. (-unsigned)
