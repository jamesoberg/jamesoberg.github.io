					<p>On what started out as a lazy Autumn day, fresh-faced adventurers Corey, Grakhelda, Kass, and Margora found themselves in the Frigid Maiden in the midst of a slight bit of bustle. Aside from Gidjick's usual nattering at the ever-patient Jinvarax, the Alderman "Baron" Bredierre was unusually in the tavern, seemingly pleading with Gorog for some boon. Corey, wishing to relieve Jinvarax of his diminuitive tormentor, struck up a conversation with the dragonborn scholar, learning from him about his studies into the slow disappearance of the magic "weave" throughout Vria. It seems to Jinvarax that Whiptail and a large area nearby seem protected from this decay, and he suspects from his studies (and with the aid of a small device that Gidjick has created) that there is something in the mountains providing this protection, but he is too old to investigate it himself and besides, is unwilling to abandon the Scholar's Guild office entrusted into his care. He's also not willing to lend his eldritch anemometer, it being too valuable to his studies. However, Gidjick might be willing to make another one... in exchange for some lovely-smelling and apparently delicious "pink dust" (and a tree... a pine tree... big enough that two people have to drag it, please). He says he made the first Gidjick Gadget using some pink dust he found in the woods, near a something circular (and a Birch), and he can't make another one without more. 
					<br><br>
					<p>Meanwhile, Kass with a rousing song managed to convince Bredierre not to leave the tavern so quickly, and the party learned from her that her brother Henry (who calls himself 'Enry) is overdue for his cheese delivery by a couple of weeks, and she is worried about him. She fears riots of the town runs out of his wonderful cheese, and would appreciate some help tracking him down. So, heading into the lightly-wooded forest, the party followed the well-beaten path from town to the east, toward 'Enry's 'Ermit 'Ut. 
					<br><br>
					Finding the hut empty but for some kegs (one of which Kass discovered was full of cheese), cheese-making paraphernalia, a sleeping pallet, gardening tools and some books on a shelf, the party noticed that the small attached animal enclosure's fence was broken, and that some animal tracks heading north had been followed by a humanoid. It looked like 'Enry had gone after his errant flock. Margora decided to seek some animal help, and managed to attract a small sparrow, and a snow-leopard kitten, whom she kept to look after. Following the tracks until they all mysteriously disappeared on the same spot, the sparrow then helped indicate that it thought something was off to the east, but was reluctant to go any further itself. It was here that the party ran into Ghileen, an enormous Kalati barbarian, who was on the hunt for some nasty creature reputed to be in the area. With seemingly aligned purposes, Ghileen and the party stuck together and headed to the east.
					<br><br> 
					Suddenly, some joyous whistling and singing could be heard: " 'Enry the 'Ermit, that be me, an 'Ermit's life for me!". Relaxing, the players followed the voice. Corey, yelling out to 'Enry, received only the same response back... " 'Enry the 'Ermit, that be me, an 'Ermit's life for me!", accompanied by more whistling. Becoming suspicious, the party fanned out. Ghileen (by virtue of an exceptionally good perception roll) noticed a set of antlers sticking out from behind a particularly thick-trunked spruce tree. Slowly approaching, with blades at the ready, a creature suddenly burst out from behind the tree and rushed Corey, its ambush having been foiled. The party members found themselves attacked by a Wendigo, who had been mimicking the sounds of 'Enry.
					<br><br> 
					After Margora sustained a nasty claw wound (swiftly healed by Kass), the party overcame the Wendigo and Ghileen was able to recall that such creatures generally reside in caves, and are able to mimic only sounds they have actually heard... This creature had encountered 'Enry. But where could he be? 
					<br><br> 
					Margora was able to follow the creature's tracks further to the east, up towards the mountainside and past the tree line, to a dark cave. Inside the cave was a recently used fire place, some bones stripped entirely of flesh, and a three-pronged meat stand from which was suspended an upside-down, very smelly man. It was 'Enry!
					<br><br> 
					Relieved to be rescued, but concerned that no sign has been seen of his beloved goats, he suggested they might be staying with his wife, as they often are when they go missing. 'Enrietta is 'er name, and she 'as 'er own 'ermit 'ut "somewhere over there" (he pointed to the north). 
					<br><br> 
					Not being able to read or write, 'Enry suggested that the party take only a cask of cheese and their word back to Bredierre that 'Enry had been rescued and was well. His goats however, remain missing...
					<br><br> 
					Pleased with their good deed, the party went back to the pub to chew the fat and wash it down with some well-deserved ale!
                    <br><br> 
                    Until next time...
