					<h1>Your World</h1>
				</header>
				<div class="content">

					<p>This globe has many names. The Giantesses of the east refer to her simply as <i>The Eternal Mother</i>. In far-flung corners of the world, upon which no citizen of Mellgeven has yet set foot, she has names which the tongues of humans could not hope to ever utter, but to the elves, dwarves, humans, and all others in this part of the world, and according to even the most ancient and arcane of tomes, she has only ever been known as Vria. You have found yourself in a particularly frigid corner of Vria, known as <b>The Free Coast.</b>
					<br>
					<br>
					<H2>Whiptail Harbour, The Free Coast and surrounds</H2>
					<p>You are in <b>Whiptail Harbour</b>. A frontier town, at the northern edge of the frigid Free Coast, one of a series of free cities in loose association with the <b>Kingdom of Mellgeven</b>. It survives despite the harsh cold because the nearby seas are rich with kelp, fish, and many ocean-going creatures to more than sustain the small permanent population. It thrives economically solely due to the riches to be gained from furs and hides of the creatures peculiar to the coasts and islands of these high latitudes. Mellgeven is ostensibly the ruling kingdom and has nominal authority over Whiptail and the rest of the Free Coast, but in practice the region enjoys near total autonomy. Itinerant workers from the South have their hefty earnings taxed on their return to the kingdom proper, and merchants dealing in the widely sought-after northern hides are subject to heavy tariffs which boost the coffers of the southern lords, providing an incentive for the Kingdom to let the 'Coasters' be. Since the Free Coast pay no dues directly to the kingdom, and earns almost the entirety of its public funds from dock hire, berth hire, hunting licences and export duties extracted from southern merchants, it largely considers itself sovereign, and its people have a strong streak of independence and pride in their free and equal society.
					<br><br>
					The society is very liberal. Prostitution is looked upon as an honourable profession, and during the winter months, plenty of would-be courtesans of all genders and races come from the more southern lands, seeking a share in the profits being made by the hide-hunters during prime season. It's not considered rude to inquire of an acquaintance (or even a stranger, for those of a more forward disposition) if they'd be willing to undertake a carnal transaction, whether or not it's part of their profession. 
					<br><br> 
					Crime is uncommon. Fights amongst sailors with incidental property damage are generally the most serious infractions of the local law, and there does exist one set of stocks near the town hall for brawlers, rabblers, and vandals. Drunkards are commonly kept overnight in small lockups, primarily to prevent them freezing to death. For those that do commit more serious crimes, like theft or any acts of malice, the usual punishment is forced labour for months or years, and may involve press-ganging into the crew of one of the hide-hunting ships undertaking a voyage to one of the more dangerous areas of the Porcelain Sea. Murder is punished by hanging, but the gallows seldom see any use. The population may be rowdy, but not criminal. Those finding themselves on the wrong side of the law are usually young hotheaded miscreants on their first expedition seeking fortune, trying to create mischief in a small town with - at times - little to do when on land besides carouse.
					<br><br> 
					Humans and Dwarves are the most common races to be found along the Coast, but the laissez-faire society attracts people of all races and persuasions. The Free Coast is particularly unsuspicious of magic users, who in some parts of Mellgeven can be met with various levels of distrust, ranging from mild unease to flat-out animosity. In Ryarion, Mellgeven's capital, the practice of magic is outlawed, and although unwarranted violence is nominally illegal, those suspected of being magic users or even of having an innately magical nature can find themselves the target of unruly mobs of (primarily Human) bloody-minded townsfolk. There are many who take residence in the Free Coast cities effectively as refugees, seeking a life free from persecution. Other cities in Mellgeven are less hostile, generally becoming less so the further from Ryarion one travels. 
					<br><br> 
					Neighbouring Mellgeven to the west is the peninsular <b>Kingdom of Craikork</b>, which is also a mixture of Human and Dwarven citizenry, but has always been - and remains now - primarily a Hill Dwarven kingdom. Craikork is ancient. Millenia ago, a Hill Dwarven surveying expedition identified a rich vein of Mithral ore beneath the central range of rolling hills, the centre of which would become the hill-city of Korkheim. The city is known for the splendid quality of its artisans, particularly weaponsmiths and armoursmiths. The Dwarves of Craikork tolerate human presence, but anti-magic bigotry is treated with contempt and those convicted of persecution are banished on pain of death upon return. The indiginous Gnomish population has maintained a continuous presence on the peninsula throughout, and generally live in harmony with the Hill Dwarves. 
					<br><br> 
					Neighbouring central Mellgeven to the North East lies a very elevated and hilly plateau called the <b>Walmondu Highlands</b>, nestled between two mountain ranges: the Tendril Mountains to the west and north, and the range known as the Spur to the east. Here can be found the Mountain Dwarves of the Walmondu clan, who generally remain aloof but do occasionally send emissaries with trading missions to Mellgeven. Not much else is known about the Walmondu Dwarven society, and the border between the two nations is not clear, but border disputes are almost unheard of since the high altitude and relative lack of rainfall render the land of limited use for any agrarian exploitation by any potentially expansionist Mellgevennen. They are not hostile to outsiders, but generally discourage visitors. It is said their trading missions are always laden with pound upon pound of precious gems.
					<br><br> 
					Neighbouring Mellgeven to the east is the vast matriarchal empire of <b>Kalat</b>, inhabited by the nomadic and fierce Kalati, rumoured to be of giantish origin. Besides being known as fearsome warriors, they are renowned as master equestrians, requiring neither rein nor saddle to ride their steeds with unparalleled control. Kalati clans carefully tend their herds of horses, which run seemingly wild, but with whom the Kalati share their land and live in a sort of symbiosis. Kalati steeds of various breeds are coveted by every Mellgevennin of any means, and are universally considered to be the worlds finest mounts. Kalati sell their horses sparingly and only at exceptionally high prices. Mares are never sold and are forbidden to be removed from Kalat. 
					<br><br> 
					To the south of Mellgeven, across the Sea of Gloaming, lies the island republic of <b>Waterleigh</b>, a major trading partner of Mellgeven. It has a warm climate and is home to many disparate races, including even a small number of Tabaxi and Leonin. Waterleigh City is known for its superbly sheltered harbour, which hosts the largest trading hub in the known world. It's said that if you decide you're looking for something, you'll find it in Waterleigh. It is a democratic diarchic republic, with elected diarchs serving six-year terms with a three year overlap, defining each discrete 'reign'.
					<br><br> 
					To the southeast of Mellgeven, lying east of Waterleigh, can be found the Elven nation of <b>Solestria</b>, a minor trading partner of Mellgeven's, and a mixture of High elven majesty and Wood elven mystique. The elves of Solestria look down upon the mistrust of magic evident in many Mellgevennen, and tend to avoid contact where possible. Likewise, the more superstitious of the Mellgevennen regard the overtly magical Elves with mistrust and wariness. The Solestri seldom travel to Mellgeven, and likewise it's uncommon that any Mellgevennin sees fit to travel to Solestria. They are known for the superb quality of their artworks, exquisite silks, fine wines, delicate jewellery, and superior woodwork, including in crafting martial products like hunting bows and staves. Within Mellgeven, the governance and other inner workings of Solestria are opaque, and subject to widespread rumour and hearsay.
					<br><br>
					<h2>The town of Whiptail Harbour</h2> 

					Originally a Hill Dwarf outpost, Whiptail Harbour perches at the foot of the mountain range known as The Whip. Whiptail's original name is lost to history: it is conjectured that it was abandoned by the Hill Dwarves centuries ago when it became clear that the nearby mountains would yield no ores of worth. It exists at all today because superior Dwarven stonemasonry has meant that the original structures they built here have seen little to no degreadation or decay. Structures are stone throughout, and each has at least one stout chimney - most are obviously of original Hill-Dwarven construction, but some are lower-quality attempts at duplication thereof, with imprecise joins and crumbling mortar work. 
					<br><br> 
					The town is rich with odours, few of them pleasant. The docks smell strongly of fish, kelp, and rot. The nearby skinners' and butchers' quarter reeks of flesh and blubber off-cuts at various levels of decay. Tanneries are at least forbidden to operate within 500 yards of the town centre, however this doesn't prevent their foul airs mixing into the town's general miasma. There is no sewer system, and the townspeople rely on their fellow citizens' individual discipline in digging private latrines, but this actually doesn't seem to affect the overall smell very much. In fact the only thing saving the city from being universally fetid seems to be the ubiquitous slivers of smoke escaping from every chimney, painting the ice-blue sky with charcoal streaks, and lightly overlaying the general acrid aroma with that of delicate woodsmoke, for which even a forest elf might find himself expressing silent thanks. 
					<br><br> 
					It's Autumn, and it's lightly snowing. Icicles adorn every eave. The wide streets are mostly white with recent snow, with a few brown streaks betraying the passage of a few denizens and even fewer horse-drawn carts and wagons. The town does not have a great amount of commerce which is not in some way related to the products of the sea. There are plenty of tanneries and leatherworkers, but only one smithy, operated by a half-dwarf whose slow, deliberate hammer blows can be heard across town shortly after sunrise. There's one general store which sells only the basics - dry rations, knives, simple tools, et cetera. Tradespeople are available, but mostly of the simple crafts - there are tailors, masons, and carpenters to be found, but no jewellers, alchemists or scribes.
					<br><br> 
					Curiously for a tiny frontier town, there is one studious establishment to be found, run by a member of the Scholar's Guild, as indicated by the guild marker on the ornate door. The building is one of the few sporting a proper sign, which is wooden and features a large open tome in carefully carved relief, on which the open page reads the word "Arcana" written in Common - albeit in a florid, decorative style. 
					<br><br> 
					The town hall (if it's to be called that) is simply the largest of the original dwarven buildings, and was probably originally a drinking hall rather than a municipal building. The Town Hall is the meeting place of the Town Council of thirteen citizens, which in turn elects the town Alderman to act as general administrator. By tradition, the Alderman is referred to by the title of "Baron", but this has no bearing on his or her actual rank or recognised nobility anywhere outside of Whiptail. 
					<br><br> 
					There are several inns, but most are shut during the summer and only operate during the colder hunting months when the town's population swells with itinerant sailors and workers. The only inn permanently open is also the largest, and doubles as a tavern; The Frigid Maiden. Situated about a hundred yards from the water's edge at the mid point between the docks and the town centre, it features a bawdy sign of a naked female merfolk bearing two foaming steins and an inviting smile. The town lacks a temple, so the tavern bears the unusual distinction of doubling as a place of worship - one small room is set aside for the devout, with a leadlight window, and a small stone altar of no particular divine dedication (those with fluency in ancient Dwarven would recognise that the runes near the altar indicate that it was originally dedicated to Moradin, most senior of the Dwarven gods).
					<br><br> 
					Locals can always be found in the tavern, and a select few can be found there more often than not. Choose one amongst them to be your friend.

                        <p>Amond the Human male is about the most stereotypical seagoing braggart you've ever imagined. It would seem that he talks about himself, his exploits, and little else. He purports to be a former pirate, and is constantly telling tales of all of the high-seas adventures he has embarked upon, which you silently calculate - if all of them were true - would make him about two-hundred years old. He's clearly seen action on the seas and is covered in scars, and it's obvious he has a great deal of actual knowledge of the sea, but it's hard to tell where the truth ends and his braggadocio begins.</p>

                        <p>Brauggi looks to be a Hill Dwarf. He has very dark, shifty eyes, giving the appearance of black onyx set into marble. He has black hair and a ruddy-brown complexion and a bright red nose. He sports a very full black beard, braided with care and bound with a number of small golden, bejewelled rings. He has seven gold earrings adorning his right ear. He has two large poniards by his side, both with cloudy jadestones set into the hilt. On several of his digits he wears what appear to be rings set with garnets, topaz, and even a fire opal. He speaks roughly and with what seems an exaggerated rasp, even for a dwarf. It can be difficult to detect whether his laugh is intended in mirth or scorn.</p>

                        <p>Galistae is a performer and occasional courtesan, and might be the most beautiful woman you've ever seen. She's an elf or half-elf, it's hard to say. She's uncommonly tall for either race, well over six feet. She has fiery auburn hair and golden skin, is graceful and lithe, but also obviously muscular and able to handle herself, as evidenced by the two curved knives at her side. She sings and plays the Elven Galira with most unusual tunes and foreign lyrics, and gives off a mixed impression of fearful strength and welcoming curiosity. An obviously natural performer, her singing voice is exquisite and expresses the full range of emotions with seemingly effortless ease.</p>

                        <p>Gellen is a quiet young human man, apparently a sailor, but slight of build and lacking the usual sinewy limbs of a sheethand. He says little, and what he does say is delivered with a flat, even (but not unfriendly) tone, and a low pitch. He has brown, lightly wavy hair and bright green eyes. His facial expression seldom changes, and he seems to nurse drinks for the sake of appearances. He's nicknamed "Bright Eyes" amongst the other bar patrons, which appears fitting for his handsome, unlined, and (unusually for permanent residents of Whiptail) unscarred face. His demeanour betrays a strange dichotomy: he is gentle and quiet of nature, and yet gives the impression of being constantly tense and alert.</p>

He has a wild nest of red hair, and the angular facial features one would usually expect of a gnome, were it not for his uncommonly narrow yellow eyes. Even so, he's not unhandsome, and appears very quick of wit, seemingly always in possession of a mischievous expression and armed with a characteristically high-pitched, comedically-timed witty retort in response to a jibe at his expense. With patchwork clothing, and apparently little in the way of social grace, He is loud and outspoken, but falls short of overtly rude.</a>).</p>

He looks to be aged, as his colour seems unclear, and in some places, entirely faded. He seems to be a scholar, as he carries a book and gnarled staff. His legs are bandaged, but he doesn't appear to be wounded - it looks to be the sort of binding designed to support an ailing limb. Despite the evidence of age, his eyes appear darting, and his motions fluid and lithe.</p>
