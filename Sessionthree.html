					Starting in the carnage of the slain troupe of Kobolds recently slain, the party decided the first thing to do would be to test their solution to the riddle from last week. Unfortunately, the gaming set in Kass's pack that he thought might contain some dice, contained only playing card paraphernalia. What to do? Ever resourceful, the party hatched a plan to take one of Kass's leaden sling bullets, and take advantage of Grakhelda's proficiency with smith's tools to hammer the soft lead sphere into a cubic shape, and knock a number of dots into its faces (one-and-one-score dots in total!). Applying the dice to the door, rolling sixes and ones in front of it, saying the word "dice" to the door in Dwarven... nada. Then in a moment of inspiration, Kass instead rolled the dice AT the door... into which it sunk and disappeared!
					<br><br>
					Open sesame! The Dwarven hoard had been uncovered. Unfortunately, the mining gear, weapons and armour had almost entirely disintegrated ages past. However, conspicuously undamaged and in perfect condition were a pair of nice-looking mountain boots, and a gold-rimmed monocle. Upon further inspection, the hoard room yielded a 1-pound clear crystal ball, a pair of goggles, two small uncut rubies, a large and perfectly clear square-cut ruby, and a pile of electrum, gold, and platinum coins. Lucrative! Kass tried on the goggles, and noticed that his vision was extended, even in the dark. Upon Corey trying on the goggles, it was noticed darkvision was granted through them. What luck! Margora tried on the boots and tried to run headlong into a wall... and... she uh... then ran headlong into a wall. It would seem that their function, if any, would have to wait.
					<br><br>
					But what of the goats?? They're nowhere to be seen. The system of mines having been thoroughly explored, the party decide there must be something funny about the door. Recalling that the Kobolds had complained at them disappearing the moment they came in contact with the illusory door at the entrance to the mines on the mountainside, it was there they headed, with Margora closely inspecting the entrance and planning to turn into a goat and experiment. Poppoing her face through the illusion, she was shocked to be immediately licked in the face... by a goat! In fact, seven goats were standing around, and a handsome but hardy-looking middle-aged lady with greying red hair, and a grey dress. "I'm sorry, I saw you go down but didn't want to follow, so I waited here. I'd be much obliged if you could take this back down to Henry for me". It was Henrietta! 
					<br><br>
					Asking her if she was Henry's wife yielded the answer: "...After a fashion". Apparently living in the mountains, which she explained as just liking it up here, the party asked what she did, to which she replied she's a historian of sorts, but that since history touches on all subjects in a way, really she's a scholar of just about anything she can get her hands on. She was also able to suggest that as far as she has read, the pink fey dust the players are seeking might be found amongst pixies, or brownies, or something of the like. Not getting too many more answers out of her, she did ask the party one boon: Does anyone have any books they're throwing away? As luck (well, a good luck roll, anyway) had it, Kass did have an old magical textbook that had been keeping the bottom of his back-pack square-shaped, so it could fit more goodies. Giving it to Henrietta prompted her eyes to widen after examining it, and offering profound thanks to Kass, who perceptively noticed that while she does look around and appear to see things, her eyes never actually move in their sockets... Strange. Anyway, having agreed to take the goats back to 'Enry, the players headed off.
					<br><br>
					Pleased with their booty and lucre, the party dropped the goats off to 'Enry who was very thankful and offered yet more cheese to each of the party in gratitude. Afterward, they then headed back to town, aiming to tell Jinvarax about having seen a gargantuan dragon in the depths of the mines. Returning at about sunset, they took some short stops to change their strange old coins into modern gold, as well as to stock up on some decent quality armour and weapons. Thereafter, they walked into the tavern, to find Jinvarax and Gidjick missing, but the other usual suspects were about. Corey tortured poor quiet Gellen by repeatedly casting Disguise Self, while Kass and Margora sat with Brauggi to try and fence their gemstones. With offers bordering on the insulting, Brauggi acknowledged his offers were too low, but that up here, he'd be struggling to on-sell them to anyone anyway... in his words, "if you were in a bigger town, or talking to a jeweller, it'd be different... but you're a long way from both!"
					<br><br>
					So, no success with converting gems to gold at this point, although the party have managed to acquire quite the collection (see Appendix Two below). Moving on, after sunset, our adventurers visited the scholar's guild and knocked on the door, which was almost immediately opened by a breathless Gidjick, prompting a quick scolding from Jinvarax, who is very protective of his office. Notably, languishing on the back of Jinvarax's chair, was a handsome little Pseudodragon which looked with indifference at the party before noticing Corey, and becoming immediately entranced. Flying from its perch on the chair, it landed on Corey and placed itself across its shoulders - tail on one side, and head on the other, immediately chittering and chattering at him in the way only Pseudodragons can, conveying ideas of hunting mice and squirrels, the joys of freedom in flight, the comfort of fireplaces, and so on. 
					<br><br>
					Noticing this, and without a hint of jealousy, Jinvarax exclaimed "Goodness, he likes you! He's never been nearly so friendly with me". Jinvarax explained that this little fellow had come to him not long after he had moved up here from the south, some dozen years ago or so. He comes and goes as he pleases, and Jinvarax appreciates his company enough to have given him a name, "Fantus". With Kass enduring Fantus's attentions, the party explained to Jinvarax what they had all seen. Convinced of your earnestness, but sceptical of your descriptions, Jinvarax was intrigued enough to agree to come to the old mines the following morning. Also, after the suggestion that brownies or pixies might be in possession of the fey dust for Gidjick, Jinvarax twigged that early on in his Whiptail days, while exploring the surrounds of the town, he had come across a dense bit of forest and thought he had seen a Dryad flitting about the trees. If pixies or brownies are to be found, a Dryad would be a great place to start. He promised to point out the area on the morrow, it being fairly close to the mountain in question. Satisfied with plans to meet Jinvarax at daybreak tomorrow, the party left, with Fantus enthusiastically accompanying Corey. "Well, it seems he's chosen to follow you!" said a good-natured Jinvarax.
					<br><br>
					So, the party left and retired to bed, with Fantus curled up at the corner of Corey's bed. Come morning, Fantus was gone, apparently having left in the night. Leaving the tavern to once more head to the Scholar's guild, the party were met by Jinvarax sternly telling Gidjick to look after the guild office (and to stop opening the door), as well as Fantus, who again settled on Corey's shoulders. Setting off, the players made their way to the entrance to the old mines (at which point the seemingly fickle Fantus decided to fly off once more), and then to the disguised door deep within the mountain, upon which Jinvarax nervously knocked. There came a bellowing answer in an ancient form of Draconic, which Jinvarax translated: "I DO NOT HAVE A HOARD! I DO NOT WORSHIP TIAMAT! BEGONE!". Gently placating the source of the bellowing by announcing peaceful and helpful intentions, the door opened, to reveal the same dragon the party had seen on their previous visit. Not having been reduced to quivering panic this time, the party were able to better take in its visage.
					<br><br>
					Standing at least 50 feet in height even when on all four feet, you struggle to comprehend how ancient this being must be. It's of a type none of you have ever seen, heard of, or even read about. It is indeed red, but it doesn't appear to be a chromatic Red Dragon. Instead, its skin is comprised of red crystalline scales, which reflect light like glass might. Both its scales and skin are evidently partially see-through, allowing you to see sinews of muscle and tendon as it moves, and the hind of gigantic organs underneath. Its claws look like solid glass dyed dark russet-red, and ruby-like, segmented whiskers adorn its face. Whenever the dragon moves or speaks, as its crystalline scales and whiskers meet, they produce light sounds of tinkling and ringing, causing the huge chamber in which she sits to be filled with a beautiful harmonious sound, as though it were bedecked with a thousand tiny wind chimes. The one part of the magnificent creature which isn't red is its eyes, which are a milky white, as though carved of marble.
					<br><br>
					Relations started with the dragon verbally expressing mild displeasure at the party for having barged in uninvited yesterday, but it was quickly mollified once it became clear that intentions were pure. The dragon is seated in front of a sort of laboratory, including what looks like an enormous magnifying glass, some oversized alchemical equipment, and piles upon piles of books. After a little chit chat, the creature revealed it is trapped here by some kind of magical "drain" which is dangerous to her if she ventures too far from the mountain. An astute Corey asked the creature if the books behind her had anything to do with a certain old textbook, previously owned by Kass. He was met with a wry smile: "You're a perceptive one", the dragon replied. She was Henrietta! She introduced herself as Laalraxeardeash (or Laal for short) and shortly was conveying her story: She and her six siblings were the first ever dragons, created uncountable aeons ago by Asgorath, the progenitor of Bahamut and Tiamat, the Dragon Gods. She's been asleep for many thousands of years, awoken only by the ebbing away of her life force, caused by this mysterious "drain" of magic. She has no idea as to the fate of her siblings, or the cause of this drain, and cannot stray far from the mountain to investigate. She has been studying any and all books she can in order to trawl for clues, but is no closer to answers than she was when she awoke, a hundred-and-thirty years ago. She asks: "Will you help me?". See Appendix One below for her full monologue.
					<br><br>
					The party readily agreed, but asked a little help investigating this being in the chamber, to which Laal acceded, reverting back to her humanoid "Henrietta" form to accompany the party. The party initially thinking that the rock elemental previously encountered was this "being" to which Laal had been referring were corrected when it quickly became clear that she had in fact meant the statue itself! Trying to think of ways to communicate with the elemental and this "being", the players discussed some outlandish schemes, during which the listening Laal almost absent-mindedly polymorphed Margora into a fish (though she retained her intellect), and then cast tongues on her. Convenient! Able now to talk with the Elemental, not a great deal was learned. It is good-natured and seems happy to impart what it knows, but it doesn't seem to know a great deal. "I protect the protector!", it would repeat. Its instructions are to allow no harm or change to come to his charge, and it was quite firmly against allowing you to communicate with it (since that would entail a form of 'change'). It did tell you that its charge's name is "Tarthys", but it doesn't know the identity of its own master. Having exhausted lines of enquiry, the party decided to move on, parting ways with Laal and promising to keep her supplied of any information (and maybe books?) that might help her.
					<br><br>
					Jinvarax, anxious to return to his guild office to ensure that Gidjick hadn't entirely ruined it, parted ways with you and jogged south, back toward town. The party, heading north, started toward the area where Jinvarax had mentioned the party might find a Dryad. Kass, taking the opportunity to sing songs of the forest and of admiration toward Dryads, was soon rewarded with a distant visage of a smiling Dryad, beckoning the party toward her and saying "Come, you are welcome in my forest". Upon approaching, however, the being disappeared in a flash of light, and the party heard stifled laughter coming from behind them. Further pranks continued... a few floating points of light, looking as though they might be fairies, instead coalesced into the form of a smirking Dryad, which winked and disappeared again, with more laughter, less stifled this time, audible from within the forest once more. While the party was following the laughter, Margora walked onto what looked to be solid ground, but which immediately disappeared to reveal a muddy pit of water, which she sank chest-deep into. Absolutely raucous laughter was directed toward the party at this point. Margora opted to treat the prank with a good nature, and the ever-astute Kass decided to start fondling and juggling one of his small raw rubies. Not long afterward, a low, languid, disembodied voice addressed the party in Sylvan: "Could that beee.... for meee?".
					<br><br>
					With Margora translating the Sylvan for the party, Kass agreed that it <i>could</i> be for the source of the voice (maybe), and was rewarded with the sudden appearance of a beautiful, cat-sized dragonling, with bright red cheeks and eyes, an orange face and crest, yellow forelegs and trunk, butterfly-like wings of yellow, green, teal and blue in a beautiful blending pattern, and a deep indigo rear end, tipped with a long, deep violet-coloured tail. It was a playful Faerie Dragon. In exchange for the gemstone, the dragon offered to lead you to the Dryad, and then promptly flitted from tree to tree until he led you to a large mushroom circle, with instructions to wait. Not having to wait long, the party were indeed approached by a Dryad, who asked: "What brings you to my forest?".
					<br><br>
					Explaining their situation and their desire for pixie dust, the Dryad wasn't entirely convinced, but upon learning Margora's identity as a balance-loving druid, she instructed the party to wait here until midnight, with strict instructions not to light any fires, and not to enter the mushroom circle uninvited (evidently the pixies have sensitive noses). 
					<br><br>
					And that is where are party currently wait! Until next time...

					<h1>Vria Session Three Appendix 1: Laalraxeardeash's Plea</h1><br>
				<p><i>
					
					<br><br>
					My earliest memory is of Asgorath, my creator. He willed my six siblings and I into existence, and we were his first creations: the first Dragons. We were one with him, and he with us, in a way that mortals cannot understand. Our thoughts and feelings were in perfect balance, and always intertwined, transcending distance and time. We worked toward equity, peace, stability. It proved too much a task. When Asograth was torn asunder by the Priomordial Erek-Hus, it took a terrible toll. We remained, but he who was our creator and our source of balance was gone. I felt our thoughts and feelings torn apart in an instant, our minds separated. The instant grief and loneliness was too much to bear. I feared insanity. In desperation, I fled the celestial plane to the material plane, to escape the madness of the Gods, quickly made a creche for myself, and slept, waiting either for the end of the grief to awaken me, or to sink into oblivion. 
					<br><br>
					I may never have awoken were it not for this drain... My nightmares slowly drifted from the agony and panic of sudden solitude, into the feeling of sinking... into the rock. Being used by it, eaten by it, having my life force appropriated against my will. The indignation at the injusticed being served upon me awoke me about 130 of your years ago. This world has indeed become strange, there is little I understand. Seeking shelter from this awful affliction, after searching I came to this mountain for protection, for the being in the smaller chamber is providing shelter from the Drain, though I cannot claim to understand how it is achieved. I cannot leave without my life force becoming compromised... It has already taken the function of my eyes, and my magic cannot restore them. How I long to properly see colour once again...
					<br><br>
					I cannot become comfortable with this isolation you mortals take as a natural state of being... Even now I long for the minds of my brethren, but reaching out, I do not hear them. 
					<br><br>
					I cannot stray far from this mountain, lest I risk the loss of my other senses. From here I can do little but vainly study and re-study what little literature I have been able to acquire for clues... I have found nothing so far, and the going is slow - this device helps, but slowly. I must either find the cause of this Drain and stop it, or find some way of protecting myself from it, so I may leave this mountain. and find my brethren once again, if they still exist. Will you help me?
