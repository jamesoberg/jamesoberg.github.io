					Our adventurers started this session in a dense patch of forest, having been advised by Dryad to wait until midnight next to a fairy circle of mushrooms. Sure enough, come midnight, eight flittering pixies appeared, each giving off a particular colour of light. From their constant chattering at one another, it became clear that their names were Tulip (the red), Marigold (the orange), Daffodil (the yellow), Dahlia (the green), Periwinkle (the blue), Hyacinth (the indigo), Hibiscus (the violet), and Thistle (the pink). They seemed very happy and exited to have visitors, if a little shy. "Oooooh visitors!", they excitedly exclaimed, "Did Cyrilla send you?". It became clear that all of the pixies were of a very happy disposition, and happy to trade a little of their dust for a simple dance... except gravelly-voiced, grumpy Thistle. After throwing around a few ideas, Margora proffered a piece of 'Enry's cheese, which simply set the pixies wild! With the help of a handful of corked wooden tubes provided by Cyrilla the dryad, the party collected pixie dust of all eight colours.
					<br><br>
					But what does the dust do? What sort of scientific or careful arcane investigation should be undertaken to ascertain the effect that each had? Ever the pragmatist, Kass had the answer: Huff it straight up the nostrils. Trying some of the orange dust, he felt briefly as though it was lulling him to sleep, but the effect was fleeting and perhaps due to his fey ancestry, he remained perfectly awake and alert. Moving on to the yellow dust, he bumped a tiny line and felt instantly happy and joyful. After the rest of the party wrested the yellow dust from Kass before it could find its way up his nose, some more experimentation was done and it was found that the dusts elicited the following results:
					<br><br>
					Red: Affection<br>
					Orange: Soporific<br>
					Yellow: Joy<br>
					Green: Nausea<br>
					Blue: Forgetfulness<br>
					Violet: Lust
					<br><br>
					Arcane investigations of the indigo and pink dusts yielded that the party could tell that the effect of indigo dust wouldn't be pleasant, but none was huffed to find out anything more. Pink dust gave the distinct impression of unpredictability. 
					<br><br>
					So, with the dancing and dust snorting all said and done, the party were again visited by the Dryad, who now that the party had gotten what they had come for, asked a boon of the party. There is a nearby forest which in the past has always been pristine and well-looked after, until recent years when it seems to be being corrupted. Cyrilla herself is not able to leave her forest to investigate the cause lest something similar were to happen to her forest during her absence, so he has requested that the party investigate for her, and offered the services of a troupe of sprites and brownies to assist. Agreeing to stay after being asked, the party slept in the mushroom circle (after being invited) which magically kept them warm during the cold autumn night, to be met with a party of foot-high four brownies armed with (very) short bows and spears, and eight winged and fierce-looking (yet very tiny) sprites sporting (extremely) short bows and swords. 
					<br><br>
					The leader of the troupe was a brownie who introduced himself as Droodwin. He went on to explain that the sister forest of Cyrilla's seems to have been slowly overtaken by spiders. Trees are dying, waters are becoming stagnant and fetid, webbing is expanding outward further and further, coming close to encroaching on the borders of Cyrilla's forest. The brownies and sprites have done a lot of scouting and a little fighting, but lack the brawn to fight off the spiders. They further warned that at times they have engaged spiders in combat, often one or some of them will flee backward towards the centre of the forest to raise the alarm amongst the others... It would seem that some of them have some form of social intelligence uncommon amongst regular giant spiders. Duly briefed, the party set out, guided by Droodwin toward the centre of the sister forest.
					<br><br>
					Before long, the party detected a pair of huntsman-type giant spiders, seemingly guarding a forest thoroughfare. Successfully ambushing the spiders, the party tore them to shreds before they could do anything at all. Hurrah! However the party were denied the killing blow in both cases, with the tiny bows of the brownies and sprites finishing off the spiders. They'll be sure to write many songs about themselves!
					<br><br>
					Moving onward, the party then came to a second pair of huntsman-type giant spiders, and this time were luckily perceptive enough to also notice that there were two wolf-type giant spiders sitting above the two huntsmans, and a black recluse-type giant spider up and back, hiding among the trees. The party crept forward... Effortlessly stealthy, the brownies and sprites readied their bows in perfect silence... Margora, having turned into a giant spider herself, gently pitter-pattered with her eight legs through the trees, similarly undetected. Ghaline, Grakhelda and Corey also managed to conceal their presence. Kass, on the other hand, perhaps still a little giddy from all the snorting, clumsily stepped right on a twig and attracted attention from all the spiders right away. The fight was on!
					<br><br>
					With the aid of the sprite and brownie troupe, and after a bit of a struggle, with Kass taking many bites but managing not to become incapacitated, the players slayed all the spiders, including the wily black recluse, which tried to run away by climbing desperately into the trees, apparently in an attempt to abscond and seek help. With its escape prevented and the party safe for now, they cleaned their blades, took some deep breaths, and now await session five!
					<br><br>
					See you all soon :)
