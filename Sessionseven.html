					<p>
                    Welcome back everybody! It's been a long time...
                    <br><br>
                    So, our party begin this session in the seasonal inn, "The Grunting Walrus", having followed Galistae's advice to seek Gidjick there... It seems suspicious that he would be staying in this inn, since he has a free bed at the Scholar's Guild, and besides; he never has any money. 
                    <br><br>
					However, here he seems to be. Having booked a room in the vacant one beside Gijick's, the party took turns watching and listening at his door. At a little after three o'clock in the morning, during Margora's watch, she heard a splashing sound followed by dripping. Deciding to enter straight away, she found only a pool of water on the bed where Gidjick had been laying. Casting detect magic allowed Margora to ascertain that the water felt freezing cold, and had until recently been magical, but whatever the magic was, it had been dispersed and was quickly fading. A search of the room yielded nothing at all, not even any personal effects. The wardrobe was empty, there were no windows in the room which might explain his seemingly impossible escape, and besides the water puddle and unmade (wet) bed, the room looked essentially untouched.
					<br><br>
					While the party were sitting and discussing what to do, they were interrupted by hurried footsteps coming up the stairs. The innkeeper came straight to you and said "oh, i see you already noticed!". Questioning her revealed that she had seen Gidjick exiting via the front door, although stranglely he had not seemed to have needed to touch the door upon his exit, it looked as though it opened for him of its own accord. Seageon, an experienced tracker, could find no signs whatsoever of any exit at all, besides the tracks of the dwarven innkeeper, who had already told you that she exited and re-entered not minutes ago, as she saw Gidjick exit and tried to follow him, only to see that he had apparently vanished. What on Vria could be going on here!?
					<br><br>
					Time for some action. Taking a small wooden phial and filling it with some of the suspicious water, the party decided to go to the Frigid Maiden. Wisely checking for tracks, Seageon spotted a single set of humanoid-looking footsteps (possibly Elf or Human, judging by the size and displacement of the shoe marks), which indicated that someone had walked down the road from the east (in the direction of the Frigid Maiden), paused and seemed to shuffle in place for a few minutes, and then returned once more to back to the east. Following these tracks let straight to the front door of the Frigid Maiden. 
					<br><br>
					It was decided that Kass would stay out front and keep an eye out, while the stealthy Seageon would attempt to sneak into the Frigid Maiden and see if he could catch any troublemakers. Slowly sneaking into the front door, and not seeing any sign of any enemy, Seageon heard a sudden "GOTCHA!" from above, and found himself held by the scruff of the neck... face-first to Gorog!
					<br><br>
					"Oh.... oh it's you.... sorry.... What are you doing sneaking around my bar!?"
					<br><br>
					You quickly explained your actions and politely asked Gorog to set Seageon back down to his feet. Gorog seemed surprised, she remembers seeing Gidjick hanging around with the grey-clad Humans from Ryarion earlier last night, before your return from the forst. She doesn't remember seeing him ever leave the inn, so she's not sure how it was that he was seen by Galistae entering the Grunting Walrus. She, like some others, had a fair bit to drink last night. Furthermore, she heard someone sneak out of the tavern a little earlier tonight, and was thwarted in her attempts to work out who it was that managed to get past her usually flawless senses. She really wants to know what is going on... Who could possibly sneak past such a skillful sentinel?
					<br><br>
                    It was decided that the party would wait downstairs to see who came down. The first risers were Amond and Brauggi, both scoundrels and both very keen on starting the day with an ale, inspite of (or perhaps due to) their state of hangover. Galistae followed a bit later and is also showing a few signs of a raucous night, though not exuding breath anywhere near as acrid as that emanating from Amond and Brauggi. Questioning her again about Gidjick doesn't yield a great deal more information, only that she saw him hanging about with the grey-clad humans who were mostly keeping to themselves, and then never again for the rest of the night, besides when she went for a walk to the docks and spotted him near the Grunting Walrus. He looked as though he was waiting for somebody, but upon meeting eyes with Galistae, he turned and entered the Walrus. That's the extent of her knowledge. 
					<br><br>
                    Reeshaka the Leonin and Xolxin the Tabaxi then descended, and took a seat together near the windows facing the sea.	Gellen also came down the stairs, although he seemed to be careful and guarded (even more than usual) in his descent. Corey joined him and kept him some company. As the morning wore on, still others descended, including five humans of Boust, two Elves seeming to be of the High Elf extraction, four Hill Dwarves and a Halfling. No sign of the aloof grey-clad Humans you spotted last night, and whom you have heard Gidjick had been hanigng out with.
					<br><br>
					Bringing up the subject with Gorog and asking permission to go and summon them for breakfast, Gorog instead volunteered to do the summoning herself... If there are potential trouble-makers in her inn, she wants to be the first to find out. So up the stairs she went, closely followed by the rest of the party. Knocking on the door, it was swiftly opened a crack and through the door could be seen four half-clad humans slowly rousing... and an unconscious Gnome on the floor. It's Gidjick!
					<br><br>
                    But how could this be? After Gorog reminded the men that breakfast would soon be closing and that they had best come downstairs to be fed, the men slowly dressed and duly left downstairs, accompanied by Kass. Seageon and Margora (despite the mens' reservations at a strange creature like Margora entering their room) performed some first aid on Gidjick, who awoke complaining of a splitting headache, and smelling of nothing but cheap booze. He's unsure of how he came to be where he is, and remembers nothing of the night prior... In fact, he remembers nothing since about the time when the party and Jinvarax left Whiptail to explore the ancient, abandoned Dwarven mine in the mountains.
					<br><br>
                    Kass questioned the grey-clad men as to their origin and purpose. They are purportedly monks from a monastery in Ryarion, who have headed north seeking fortune to take back to their monastery. None of them have any experience in any form of hunting, and the story seems a little strange to Kass. Asked why they have hit upon this particular course of action instead of traditional methods of fund-raising, Jacobus (seemingly the leader of the group) explained that these three are the most devout of his followers, and that he has ultimate confidence that they will not fail in their duty to bring back funds to the monastery, even in spite of a total lack of experience or skill. All of them seem like typical fanatics, and predictably trepidatious of the blue-skinned giant-like Margora, whom Jacobus openly questions as to whether she is a magical being, invoking fear in his three followers (who are named Esmund, Russ, and Eldon). All are wearing a stylised sun on their neck chains, and claim to be Bringers of Light, opposed to superstition and "magic", dedicated to bringing the truth to people and freeing them from the tyranny of falsehood.
					<br><br>
                    Meanwhile, Seageon performed a thorough search of the personal effects of the men, finding nothing, <i>except</i> a pair of sodden leather shoes, which had seemingly been recently used to trudge through the morning snowy mud. Most curious! However, nothing else suspicious was found via his careful rifling. Seagon was also careful to coneal any signs of his clandestine search.
                    <br><br>
                    So, what to do next? The party decided to take Gidjick to Jinvarax and try to find out more. More in-depth questioning at the Scholar's Guild sadly yielded little... Gidjick remembers only flashes of discussions with the men in grey, about "magic" (or the Milk, as he puts it) being completely misunderstood by anyone but himself. The small phial of water was offered to Jinvarax, along with an explanation as to its origin, and questions as to what kind of magic could explain what the party has been observing. Jinvarax isn't sure... He has heard of necromancy magic being able to completely copy a being, but not with the result that the copy ends up disintegrating into water. He's also aware of illusory magic being able to produce almost everything the party has seen, but this would not be compatible with the corporeal nature of whatever it was that seemed to have been taking the place of Gidjick in the Grunting Walrus. He promises to consult his library and report to you what he finds. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the mean time, Gidjick says he will use the pink dust you found (and the medium-sized pine tree you felled for him) to produce another weave-wind gauge, or "Milk Vector Anemometer", as he would put it. It will take a few days though, he will let you know when it's finished.
                    <br><br>
                    Hatching on a plan to impersonate a cultist from another chapter of the "Bringers of Light", Corey decides to attempt to infiltrate this group to attempt to find out more about them. Will this work? Time will tell...
                    <br><br>
