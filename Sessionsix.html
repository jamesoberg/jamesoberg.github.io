					Having dispatched the ugly purple spider-human thingy (whatever it was?), and breaking up the burning central cocoon-like object before whatever it contained could be burnt to death, the party cleared out the charred remains, and were met with an uncontrollably wailing Dryad-type creature, but with male rather than female features. Unsure of what exactly to do to help, the party gave him a small sample of the yellow pixie-dust, which seemed to induce a happy sort of response when tested in the past... This briefly had an effect, with the creature (by the name of Caer-Cavverhal, you've managed to gather between gasping wails) taking on a briefly content appearance, but the effect was vanishingly short-lived, and he soon reverted to his abject state of despair. He exhibited a desire to forget, but Kass objected to feeding him any of the Periwinkle (blue) pixie dust which had exhibited such an effect before.
					<br><br>
					Instead, the players left Caer-Cavverhal in the care of the Sprite & Brownie troupe and quickly travelled back to Cyrilla the Dryad's forest for some advice. Producing a magical acorn from within her branches, she handed it to the party with instructions to give it to Caer-Cavverhal, who she described as a "Forestal". Hurrying back and doing as bidden, the Forestal seemed to calm upon ingesting the seed, at least enough to meekly take direction and walk through the cobweb-infested corrupted forest to the border where you first entered with Droodwin's soldiers. There, you met the waiting Cyrilla, who thanked the party for their intervention on the forest's behalf, and gave them a wooden ocarina, "for use in times of need"... You're not sure what actually happens if you're to play it, but you also didn't ask, so I suppose that will be a fun surprise! Walking away from the duo, Cyrilla seemed to closely but silently observe Caer-Cavverhal, who also said nothing and sat cross legged, staring at the ground. This is how you left them.
					<br><br>
					Right, time to head back to town, at last! An easy sojourn, the party travelled unmolested by vicious spiders or mischievous fey-dragonlings, to arrive back in Whiptail Harbour. Once there, a couple of ships that hadn't been in port before were noticed - one of them a beautiful Elven caravel bearing trading flags of Waterleigh as well as the Solestrian mast-pennant, the other a less aesthetically-pleasing fluyt of Mellgevennin design and with a Boustian flag (most of you would be aware Boust is a major southern trading port of Mellgeven). It would seem there are some newcomers in town. 
					<br><br>
					Rested enough already, the party headed straight to the Scholar's Guild to pass on the good news about the pink dust to Gidjick... who oddly enough, wasn't there. Jinvarax relates that upon his return, he was a little annoyed to find that Gidjieck had left and had not locked the door, though nothing is missing and the office seems to be in good order. Jinvarax is clearly enjoying the solitude, but says he hasn't seen Gidjick since he left with you to visit the mountains a couple of days ago. Jinvarax is too busy for that pest anyway, pre-occupied with trying to find any clues from history in his own library that might help shed some light onto the the dragon Laal's strange story about ancient missing siblings.
					<br><br>
					A visit to the Frigid Maiden revealed some of the newcomers to town were wetting their whistles, most notably a fierce-looking Leonin and a Tabaxi, who were seated together as you entered. Besides those two, all told and including those you passed in the street, you saw several Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes, Elves and a Halfling who hadn't been in town when you left.
					<br><br>
					Also in the tavern's main drinking hall were Amond, Brauggi, Galistae and of course Gorog, the barkeep. A questioning of Galistae revealed that she had seen Gidjick entering the other tavern which has only just opened to accommodate the expanding winter population; the Grunting Walrus. Jumping to action, the party left straight away to find him.
					<br><br>
					After some ethically questionable tactics were employed (pretending to be health inspectors quarantining Gidjick, and threatening to shut the place down? Oh my!) to gain entry to the inn, the party went to Gidjick's room and Corey, craftily disguised as Jinvrax, entered. Gidjick was half-asleep, and didn't seem too talkative at all, very quiet, and just seeming to want to be by himself. When the others entered, he was heard to remark "Who are you?", and was acting rather strangely indeed...
					<br><br>
					Having booked the room adjoining Gidjick's, our party awaited nightfall....
					<br><br>
					See you soon!
