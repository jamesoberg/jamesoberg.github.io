					<p>After rescuing 'Enry the 'Ermit from the clutches of the dastardly Wendigo last time, our heroes took a well deserved rest at the Frigid Maiden, only slightly interrupted by the midnight entry of a freshly arrived ship's crew, full of eager fortune hunters ready for the upcoming hide-hunting season. Come morning, our intrepid bard Kass decided to regale them and the rest of the tavern goers with the musical tale of 'Enry's rescue, providing some wonderful entertainment and eliciting many tossed coins and shouted accolades from the appreciative crowd. 
					<br><br>
					Deciding to seek out the mysterious "'Enrietta", the party ask Gorog what she might know about her, but don't get too far there. Furthermore, after asking Bredierre about her supposed sister-in-law, she is evidently surprised at news of her brother's wedded status, and professes to know nothing of this "'Enrietta". However, more pressing matters are commanding her attention at present. Two Whiptail council members are informing her of an incident that seems to have occurred inland from the road to the south: there have been reports of smoke billowing from some unknown incident. Corroborating this is newly arrived companion Seageon Barkstride, a ranger from the town of Rangewood, reporting that a recent attack on his home village by some unknown actors (seemingly humans in league with Drow) has resulted in the majority of his townsmen having been killed. Unable to spare a large contingent of soldiers to immediately provide aid, Bredierre has arranged for a small party to be dispatched to the larger nearby town of Rochesmouth, from which a posse is to be launched to investigate, and if possible exact justice. 
					<br><br>
					Resolving to join this effort after attending to other local issues, the party travel east to 'Enry's 'Ermit 'Ut, to ask him about 'Enrietta. Upon entering his 'ut, he exclaims: "Have ye found me goats??", to be disappointed when met with an answer to the negative. He is also not forthcoming with terribly useful information regarding where they might be, informing the party that 'Enrietta has brought his missing goats back to him more than once in the past, and has always approached his hut from the northeast on such occasions. Also, she has never allowed him to actually come to her own 'Ermit 'Ut, insisting that he is far too smelly. However, she does seem to love 'Enry's books, "being such a clever, bookly type one". Not having much to go on, but with Margora's reliable memory and Seageon's tracking acumen, the party decide to retrace their steps and investigate the area at which 'Enry's and the goats' tracks were lost during the previous attempt to track them all down. With Margora climbing through the trees and noticing the remnants of some kind of trap having been sprung from the treetops above, and then swiftly identifying some three-toed humanoid tracks heading east, the party finally had a crumb to follow.
					<br><br>
					Following these tracks led the party eastward out of the forest and past the tree line, into the mountains past the threshold of loose scree, to the solid mountainside, where the trail suddenly disappeared. Flummoxed, Corey frustratedly walked around the spot at which the tracks abruptly vanished, and was surprised to fall directly through an illusory portion of the mountainside, into an ancient Dwarven tunnel. Hot on the trail of the precious missing goats, the players swiftly descended into darkness, led by the intrepid (and conveniently able to see in the dark) Kass. Not far into the tunnel, the party are met with an ancient sign, in a form of runic Dwarven not seen in thousands of years, reading: "We claim this mountain in the name of Durgind Fenstrad, invaders beware!". Undaunted, the party pressed on.
					<br><br>
					Having encountered and defeated a Giant Bat, as well as a small group of Kobolds inhabiting a corner of an abandoned Dwarven mining bivouac, the party learn through intimidation that a second group of larger Kobolds exists somewhere else in the Dwarven tunnel complex, "near the water". Remembering having heard some running water earlier in their explorations, the party mercifully released their two cowering Kobold captives, and moved back to this area of the tunnel where they had been able to hear running water coming from a particular tunnel they had previously avoided.
					<br><br>
					Following the water, and dealing with increasingly water-filled and slippery tunnels, the party (after some prudent precautionary explorations) came to a positively enchanting cavern, which is dimly lit by mysteriously sparkling granite walls which respond to light by filling the room with stunning rainbow spectra, and the central area of which is mostly taken up by an enchanting, kinetically responsive, phosphorescent lake, which feels like feathers, smells like a fresh morning breeze, and tastes like satisfaction itself. Margora "the ever-curious" decided to swim down and see what's below the surface of the lake. Her intuition was rewarded by the discovery of a strikingly beautiful sculpture, which subsequent history checks reveal is a non-dwarven angular-faced divinely beautiful humanoid of some kind, and is of the most absolutely exquisite level of artistry any of you have ever seen or could imagine. Bearing feathery wings, the sculpted, (presumably) male figure in the statue is roughly 25 feet tall, and is depicted bent on one knee, holding a sword blade-down by the pommel, with a serious, perhaps contemplative expression, facing directly into a large, curiously misplaced round boulder, seemingly placed in front of him. 
					<br><br>
					With superior stonecunning, Grakhelda was able to determine that the boulder is not made of natural stone. Margora attempting to Mould Earth a tiny portion of the boulder prompted it to suddenly awaken, stare at her with a quizzical expression, and speak a short sentence to her in a strange, low-pitched but somehow almost familiar language. Margora recognised something similar to the Giantish word for "Nourish", or "Nurture", in its statement to her, which was repeated verbatim once more, before the party decided to move on.
					<br><br>
					Exiting the beautiful chamber to the north, the party found themselves in a meandering natural tunnel, which led to a dead end. The reliable Corey attempted to "run through" the dead end, which only ended in a near repeat of his performance on the surface, only this time falling through a thin fragile floor, rather than an illusory one. Thankfully, the result was also similar, with Corey falling into another Dwarven tunnel. Faced with the option of travelling east and further into the mountain, or west and back toward their entry point, the party turned east, only to meet a troupe of Violet Fungi. 
					<br><br>
					After a short but vicious battle, the party vanquished the Violet Fungi, but were so taxed by the conflict that they decided to retreat back to the pool-chamber to take a short rest and recoup some energy (and abilities!).
					<br><br>
					And until next time, that is where we leave our adventurers....
