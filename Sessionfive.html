					<br><br>
					Our adventurers started this session deep within a dark, corrupted forest, having fought their way through two sets of guardian spiders, some of whom are exhibiting uncharacteristically high intelligence for spiders. Something must be up with that... Kass, having taken a beating in the most recent fracas, was kindly handed ten Goodberries by Droodwin, which he gobbled in one gulp for a little healing. Refreshed, the party pressed on.
					<br><br>
					Rolling well on both stealth and perception, the party spotted ahead of them another set of guardian spiders, this time with a giant scorpion waiting in ambush in the trees above! Very carefully setting up to spring the trap, the party ambushed the would-be ambushers, with spider-Margora's web entangling the legs of the giant scorpion, sending it plummeting to the forest floor, to suffer a lot of falling damage. Great thinking! Dispatching it and the two wolf spiders, the two remaining giant tarantulas both tried to flee to the north, toward the centre of the forest, and managed to get 120 feet before eventually being mown down by the scrambling party. Great work! Although Margora finally absorbed enough damage to be transformed back into her humanoid form (and promptly fall out of a tree as a result).
					<br><br>
					Exhilarated after battling their enemy once more, the brownies conjured another 30 Goodberries to patch up the wounds incurred, which the party duly ate, leaving only one Goodberry each left over, in case of emergency. "We must only be a few hundred feet from the forest's centre!", hissed Droodwin urgently, "Let us press on!"
					<br><br>
					And so press on the party did, coming to a central clearing in the forest, with a white beehive-shaped 15-foot tall silken object in the centre of it... and a nasty, menacing-looking purple humanoid-ish figure hanging around it. Preparing for battle once again, Margora turned into a bear, and the party crept up to the edge of the forest... and were spotted. The creature turned its black eyes exactly to where the party were preparing to set up an ambush, and immediately extended its arm, shooting a ropey stream of silk upward into the trunk of a nearby tree, using it to raise itself far off of the ground straight into the tree, and shouting in some strange language. The battle was on.
					<br><br>
					What an elusive adversary! This thing was flitting around the trees, keeping its distance both laterally and vertically, and firing out streams of entangling webbing, stifling any attempt at attack. On a hunch, Kass addressed the creature and doused the central silken hive-like object in oil, and threatened to set it alight. Met only with an expression of disinterest and contempt, Kass went ahead and set fire to it, before joining the battle. The creature seemed at best slightly annoyed... perhaps this wouldn't play out as well as Kass had hoped?
					<br><br>
					With some quick thinking, Grakhelda mounted the newly-ursine Margora, who duly dashed up the tree in which the enemy was perched, with both getting to within striking distance. Alas though, the creature instantly shot sticky silken webbing at Margora's legs, restraining her and sending her plummeting to the ground... but not before Grakhelda could leap off and grab onto a branch, remaining close to the creature, but not quite close enough to swing. In an incredible feat of strength, and heroic display of self-sacrifice, Grakhelda then swung her body back and forth while suspended from the branch, and hurled herself forward as far as she could, managing to strike at the creature with her axe before plummeting to the ground and taking some hefty damage. And what a blow! Green oozy ichor spilled from the disgusting creature.
					<br><br>
					Eight summoned giant centipedes more than two feet long suddenly filled the forest clearing, attacking all within reach, and managing to bite one of Droodwin's poor brownies, leaving two gaping puncture wounds in his torso. After only two of the centipedes had been slain, and with remainder of the swarm threatening to distract or even overcome the party, Corey cleverly took advantage of one of his precious few spell slots, and managed to send ALL of the centipedes to sleep in one fell swoop. Well done!
					<br><br>
					... But what's that noise coming from the aflame silken object? Crying and wailing? Oh my! Margora could hear that the source of the voice sounded as though it were speaking Sylvan, and Kass was able to deduce that whatever language it was speaking, it was familiar enough that he knew it must be related to Elvish. Breaking from the battle, he attempted to extinguish the flames he had so recently gone to all the trouble of setting, in a failed attempt to goad the creature. With one less blade available to fight the dastardly monster, the party's attentions were once again split.
					<br><br>
					However, with other enemies now slain and the party free now concentrate attacks upon only the purple creature, they continued to do what they could to engage it in combat, with Margora attempting once more to climb, and the sprites and brownies peppering the beast with arrows. With a flash of insight, Corey remembered he might use his Hex ability to attempt to dislodge the creature from the tree. Shouting his clever rhyming Hex, he did indeed manage to dislodge its grip form the tree, and down it fell. Good thinking! Even though the creature had managed to summon more giant spiders to aid it, it was made short work of while on the ground, and at last the party slew the beast, eliciting whoops of joy and elation among their faerie-folk companions. Hurrah!
					<br><br>
					With their master dead, the remaining spiders stopped moving, looked docile for a moment, then seemed to "come to" and flee from the clearing, as you might expect a spider to do in broad daylight, especially when suddenly met with more than a dozen sources of potential threat. The neglected centipedes also slinked off demurely upon awakening. The party were now free to extinguish the flames threatening to engulf whatever creature was moaning inside this silken enclosure. Doing so revealed a dryad-like creature, with a body made of wood and branches, hair of twigs and leaves, but definitely male-looking, and therefore not a dryad. Crying and wailing seemingly uncontrollably, the party considered what to do...
					<br><br>
					... and the results of their consideration will have to wait until next session. See you then!
